# IAL-Homework-2
In the second homework, which you can find in the assignment URL link (IAL course Moodle > Homework > 2nd homework), the following three examples await you:

hashtable: table with scattered entries (3b)
btree/rec: binary search tree and operations on it implemented recursively (3.5b)
btree/iter: binary search tree and operations over it implemented iteratively (3.5b)
Your task is to complete the function bodies in the files hashtable/hashtable.c, btree/rec/btree.c and btree/iter/btree.c and transfer them via STUDIS as a tar archive preserving the directory structure (uncompressed in UTF-8 encoding). Do not tamper with other files or modify function rules.
