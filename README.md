# IAL-Homework-2
In the second homework, which you can find in the assignment URL link (IAL course Moodle > Homework > 2nd homework), the following three examples await you:

-hashtable: table with scattered entries

-btree/rec: binary search tree and operations on it implemented recursively

-btree/iter: binary search tree and operations over it implemented iteratively

The task is to complete the function bodies in the files hashtable/hashtable.c, btree/rec/btree.c and btree/iter/btree.c
